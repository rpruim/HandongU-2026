# Draft Schedule 

Some notes about the schedule:

1. This is a draft and subject to change. In particular, we 
are waiting for some input from Joseph Cho and Hangin Lee about 
their preferences.

2. Items in *italics* are options we can decide about.

3. Items that are ~~struck through~~ are also options, but I'm assuming they won't happen unless I get feedback to the contrary.

3. Items in **bold** are planned, but they can be removed 
or adjusted as desired.

4. Jim VanderMay is currently scheduled for Thursday mid-day. It is possible that might move to Tuesday. If so, we can swap some things between those two days.

5. Once we confirm a few more details I'll start the process of finding out who is available for various meals.

6. I expect we will have someone from Calvin available to do airport pickup and drop-off. (Detailed flight info would be 
good so they can monitor the flight status.)

7. There are a couple more things I'm trying to schedule -- I'm hoping on Monday morning.

8. It would be good to get the details about Joseph's and Hanjin's presentations sorted soon so we can publicize them.

In this keynote, Jim VanderMey draws on decades of real-world practice as a technologist and his formation in theology to explore how we can surface these hidden choices, provide ethical leadership in a pluralistic society, and anticipate the long-term consequences of what we build — before they are felt.
